#### 1. Introductory information

Two Matlab codes are provided. 

- First one (cc.m) is  for the boxplots and the hypothesis testing of the difference between value distributions of the selected physical activity variables between 2019 and 2020
-  In the second one (FitData.m) are the hypothesis tests on the distributions of the values of the selected physical activity variables between students living with peers/alone and the students living with parents

#### 2. Methodological information
The data from the Erasmus MC is tested by selected variables. First the hypothesis test for variable values between 2019 and 2020 is done.
Afterwards, for both years, the hypothesis test was done on the difference between students living with parents and students living alone/with peers. 
In both codes the boxplots have been plotted first to get an impression on the distribution of the data, so that the appropriate hypothesis test can be selected afterwards.

#### 3. Data specific information
The used values from the datasets

-The used variables from the Dataset are:
	- Living situation
	- The year of measurement
	- Steps counted by App, 
	- steps counted by Omron, 
	- IPAQ scores before and after measurements, 
	- BMI


The more detailed explanation of the code is provided in the code comments

#### 4. Sharing and Access information
The data is used only for the educational purposes of the TU Delft IER course.
